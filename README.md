The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator is a web-based tool that allows users to calculate their BMI based on their weight and height. BMI is a simple and widely used method to estimate whether a person’s body weight is appropriate for their height. The project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface and interactive functionality.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:

Enable users to input their weight and height.
Calculate the BMI using the formula:
BMI

Height (m)
2
BMI= 
Height (m) 
2
 
Weight (kg)
​
 
Display the calculated BMI along with its corresponding health category.
